### A mystical CSS icon solution

grunticon is a [Grunt.js](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/) task that makes it easy to manage icons and background images for all devices, preferring HD (retina) SVG icons but also provides fallback support for standard definition browsers, and old browsers alike. From a CSS perspective, it's easy to use, as it generates a class referencing each icon, and doesn't use CSS sprites.

grunticon takes a [folder of SVG/PNG files](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/tree/master/example/source) (typically, icons that you've drawn in an application like Adobe Illustrator), and [outputs them](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/tree/master/example/output) to CSS in 3 formats: [svg data urls](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/example/output/icons.data.svg.css), [png data urls](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/example/output/icons.data.png.css), and [a third fallback CSS file with references to regular png images](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/example/output/icons.fallback.css), which are also automatically [generated and placed in a folder](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/tree/master/example/output/png).

grunticon also generates [a small bit of JavaScript](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/tasks/grunticon/static/grunticon.loader.js) to drop into your site, which asynchronously loads the appropriate icon CSS depending on a browser's capabilities, and a preview HTML file with that loader script in place.

You can see [a demonstration of the output here](http://filamentgroup.github.com/grunticon/example/output/preview.html#embedded-svg-option).

## Version 2.0 is out - Here's What's New!

With Grunticon version 2.0, we've added the `enhanceSVG` option which allows you
to easily  style and animate your SVGs with CSS or add interactivity with JavaScript.
Standard Grunticons are static background images that can't be styled or scripted
because SVG only supports this ability if the SVG data is in the HTML document.
In 2.0, you can now choose which icons you want to "enhance" and the new loader
script will copy the icon SVG paths from the cached Grunticon stylesheet and inject
them as an embedded SVG element for you to script and style as needed. This allows
us to offer the best of both worlds: the full power of embedded SVGs but with none
the wasted bandwidth of including SVGs in your page markup.

Remember that only browsers that support SVGs will see these effects so use them
only for "enhancements" that don't break the experience when not present. Embedding
icons also has some degree of execution overhead so we recommend using this feature
sparingly: only embed an icon if you need to apply style or scripting, otherwise
use the classic background-image icon.

To start - in your Gruntfile.js, set the value for `enhanceSVG` to `true` so the
loader will parse the markup for icons that should be embedded at runtime:

```JavaScript
grunticon: {
  foo: {
    files: {
      // Handle files here
    },
    options: {
      // Handle your options as you normally would here
      enhanceSVG: true
    }
  }
}
```

Then, make sure you get the new loader that's produced for you when you run `grunt` (it should be in the [same place as before](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/example/output/grunticon.loader.js)) and inline that script in the `<head>`.

Just after the loader, you'll need to call `grunticon` and pass your 3 CSS file paths to it as usual. Additionally though, you'll want to add a fourth argument to kick off the SVG embedding, which we've pre-defined for you as `grunticon.svgLoadedCallback`. In all, your call to `grunticon` will now look something like this:

```JavaScript
grunticon(["icons.data.svg.css", "icons.data.png.css", "icons.fallback.css"], grunticon.svgLoadedCallback );
```

After you've done this, you can have any icon embedded in the page and ready for styling just by adding a `data-grunticon-embed` attribute.

```html
<div class="icon-burger alt" data-grunticon-embed></div>
```

Once the loader runs, the SVG will be embedded:

```html
<div style="background-image: none;" class="icon-burger alt">
  <svg class="svg-source" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="30" viewBox="170.6 12.6 32 30" enable-background="new 170.6 12.6 32 30">

</div>
```

Now, style appropriately:

```css
  .icon-burger {
    width: 32px;
    height: 30px;
    display: inline-block;
  }
  .icon-burger.alt .cheese {
    fill: red;
  }
  .icon-burger.alt .buns {
    fill: orange;
  }
  .icon-burger.alt .burger {
    fill: yellow;
  }
  .icon-burger.alt .lettuce {
    fill: green;
  }
```

And voila! Styled SVG icons!

### Also: How to use SVG Embedding across domains

If you're hosting your grunticon CSS on a different domain than your HTML, you will need to do a little extra configuration to use SVG Embedding.

1. Set the `corsEmbed` option to `true` in your gruntfile. This adds a little extra scripting to the grunticon loader so that it can make a cross-domain request.
2. Once that's in, change the callback at the end of your grunticon call to reference `svgLoadedCORSCallback` instead of the one listed above.
3. That might be enough, but if not, you'll need to enable cross-domain requests on the server where the CSS is hosted. Here's how that looks in Apache .htaccess for example:

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</IfModule>
```

(That "*" can be a particular domain if you want)

## Before you get started!

[You are using Windows ?](?#windows) 

[Have you seen Grumpicon?](http://grumpicon.com)

[<img src="http://filamentgroup.com/images/grunticon_workflow_grumpicon.jpg" width="400">](http://grumpicon.com)

[Grumpicon](http://grumpicon.com) is a browser-based app that performs much of the functionality of Grunticon through a simple drag and drop interface. It's much easier to set up than Grunticon, and sometimes, it's all you need (though it won't always be!)

If you're interested in trying out Grumpicon, you might be interested in this handy guide as well: [Grumpicon Workflow](http://filamentgroup.com/lab/grumpicon_workflow/)

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. You might also check out Chris Coyier’s great article, [Grunt for People Who Think Things Like Grunt are Weird and Hard](http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/).


Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-grunticon --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-grunticon');
```

## The "grunticon" task

For a brief overview of the Grunticon workflow, particularly from a designer's perspective, you might check out Todd Parker's article, [A Designer’s Guide to Grumpicon](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grumpicon-workflow.html), which covers basic SVG workflow tips for both Grunticon and Grumpicon.


### Required configuration properties

grunticon has a files object that needs to be filled in order to run,
this files object currently requires that a cwd, and a dest dir are
placed, and therefore will blow up without it. This will be fixed to
better fit the pattern set by Grunt for this.

These can be set in your Gruntfile.js config file. Grunticon is a multitask, making it easy to create as many export batches as you'd like. Just create one or more custom named objects within the `grunticon` object, and configure Grunticon `options` within it, like so:

```JavaScript
grunticon: {
	myIcons: {
		files: [{
			expand: true,
			cwd: 'example/source',
			src: ['*.svg', '*.png'],
			dest: "example/output"
		}],
		options: {
		}
	}
}
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** grunticon will overwrite any files in the `dest` directory if they are of the same name as a file that grunticon needs to create. For easiest results, you can set `dest` to a folder that does not yet exist in your directory and grunticon will create that folder, or set it to an existing folder and be sure to configure grunticon to create file names that do not already exist in that folder.

With these configuration properties set, you can add `grunticon` to your default tasks list. That'll look something like this:

    grunt.registerTask('default', ['jshint', 'qunit', 'concat', 'uglify', 'grunticon:myIcons']);

grunticon will now batch your icons whenever you run grunt.

### Options

#### options.datasvgcss
Type: `String`
Default value: `"icons.data.svg.css"`

The name of the generated CSS file containing SVG data uris.

#### options.datapngcss
Type: `String`
Default value: `"icons.data.png.css"`

The name of the generated CSS file containing PNG data uris

#### options.urlpngcss
Type: `String`
Default value: `"icons.fallback.css"`

The name of the generated CSS file containing external png url references.

#### options.previewhtml
Type: `String`
Default value: `"preview.html"`

The name of the generated HTML file containing PNG data uris.


#### options.loadersnippet
Type: `String`
Default value: `"grunticon.loader.js"`

The name of the generated text file containing the grunticon loading snippet.

#### options.enhanceSVG
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `False`

Include additional methods in the loader script to offer SVG embedding

#### options.corsEmbed
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `False`

Include additional methods in the loader script to offer cross-domain SVG embedding. `options.enhanceSVG` must be `true` for this option to be respected.

#### options.pngfolder
Type: `String`
Default value: `"png/"`

 The name of the generated folder containing the generated PNG images.

#### options.pngpath
Type: `String`
Default value: value of `options.pngfolder`

Allows you to specify a custom URL to serve fallback PNGs at.

Example:

```
{
    pngpath: "/assets/icons/png"
}
```

Will generate PNG fallbacks like:

```
.icon-bar {
	background-image: url('/assets/icons/png/bar.png');
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

#### options.cssprefix
Type: `String`
Default value: `".icon-"`

a string to prefix all icon selectors with (currently only classes or
ids are guaranteed to work with the preview)

#### options.customselectors
Type: `Object`

Allows you to specify custom selectors for individual files. This is in addition to the selectors generated using `cssprefix + filename - extension`.

Example:

```JavaScript
{
	"foo": [".icon-bar", ".baz"]
}
```

will produce:

```css
.icon-bar,
.baz,
.icon-foo {
	//css
}
```

You can also use an asterisk in your custom selector. The filename can be referenced with `$1`.

Examples:

```JavaScript
...
customselectors: {
  "*": [".icon-$1:before", ".icon-$1-what", ".hey-$1"]
},
cssprefix: ".icon-"
...
```

Should give the file bear.svg the css
```css
.icon-bear:before,
.icon-bear-what,
.hey-bear,
.icon-bear {
 // CSS THINGS
}
```

And if there are files bear.svg and cat.svg, the css should be like:

```css
.icon-bear:before,
.icon-bear-what,
.hey-bear,
.icon-bear {
 // CSS THINGS
}

.icon-cat:before,
.icon-cat-what,
.hey-cat,
.icon-cat {
 // CSS THINGS
}
```

This should give you more flexibility with your selectors.

#### options.defaultWidth
Type: `String`
Default value: `"400px"`

a string that MUST be defined in px that will be the size of the PNG if there is no width given in the SVG element.

#### options.defaultHeight
Type: `String`
Default value: `"300px"`

similar to defaultWidth, but for height

#### options.previewTemplate
Type: `String`
Default value: Goes to the example/preview.hbs file

Takes a path to the template that will be used for the preview.html. Example of .hbs file contents:

```html
<!doctype HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Icons Preview!</title>
    <style>
      body {
        background-image: linear-gradient(#eee 25%, transparent 25%, transparent), linear-gradient(#eee 25%, transparent 25%, transparent), linear-gradient(transparent 75%, #eee 75%), linear-gradient(transparent 75%, #eee 75%);
        width: 100%;
        background-size: 10px 10px;
      }
    </style>
    <script>
      {{{loaderText}}}
      grunticon(["icons.data.svg.css", "icons.data.png.css", "icons.fallback.css"]);
    </script>
  <noscript><link href="icons.fallback.css" rel="stylesheet"></noscript>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{#each icons}}
      {{#with this}}
      <pre><code>{{prefix}}{{name}}:</code></pre><div class="{{prefixClass}}{{name}}" style="width: {{width}}px; height: {{height}}px;" ></div><hr/>
      {{/with}}
    {{/each}}
</body>
</html>
```

#### options.tmpPath
Type: `String`
Default value: `os.tmpDir()`

Let's you specify an absolute tmp-path (`options.tmpDir` will still be appended).

#### options.tmpDir
Type: `String`
Default value: `"grunticon-tmp"`

Let's you specify a tmp-folder. Useful when having multiple grunticon tasks and using [grunt-concurrent](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-concurrent "grunt-concurrent on github").

#### options.template
Type: `String`
Default value: `""`

Location of a handlebars template that will allow you to structure your
CSS file the way that you choose. As more data becomes available via
[directory-encoder](https://github.com/filamentgroup/directory-encoder),
more options will be available for you to tap into during templating.


Example of .hbs file contents:

```css
{{#each customselectors}}{{this}},{{/each}}
{{prefix}}{{name}} {
	background-image: url('{{datauri}}');
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

#### options.compressPNG
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

Will compress the converted png files using optipng


#### options.optimizationLevel
Type: `Integer`
Default value: `3`

If compress is set to `true`, this will set the optimationLevel for optipng


#### Automating color variations

Grunticon allows you to output any icon in different colors simply by changing its filename to the following syntax: `myfilename.colors-red-aa0000-gray.svg`. In this example, any color names or hexidecimal values that follow `colors-` and are separated by a dash will be used to generate additional icons of that color. By default, each icon will be assigned a numbered class name for CSS use. You can improve the class naming conventions by defining color variables in your Gruntfile's `colors` option shown below. When defined, you can reference a color variable in place of a color in your file names, and the generated classes will use that variable name as well. See the `Gruntfile.js`'s `colors` and `dynamicColorOnly` options for an example of how color automation.

*A note on filesize impact:* Adding color variations of an icon involves creating duplicates of that icon's SVG source in the CSS, so unfortunately, each color variation will cause an increase in filesize. However, transferring CSS with gzip compression can negate much of this filesize increase, and we highly recommend always transferring with gzip. In testing, we found that creating a color variation of every icon in our example set increased overall size by 25%, rather than 100% as a raw text duplicate would increase. That said, size increases for non-SVG-supporting browsers will be more dramatic, as the fallback PNGs will not have the heavy transfer compression as SVG enjoys. We advise using this feature on a case-by-case basis to ensure overhead is kept to a minimum.

#### options.colors
Allows you to predefine colors as variables that can be used in filename color configuration.
```js
options: {
	colors: {
		myAwesomeRed: "#fc3d39",
		coolBlue: "#6950ff"
	}
```

#### options.dynamicColorOnly
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

Allows you to tell directory-colorfy to ignore the original file when
using colors.

For example, if given a file named like so:

```
bear.colors-white.svg
```

And `dynamicColorOnly` is set to `true`:

```js
{
	dynamicColorOnly: true
}
```

Then only a single file: `bear-white.svg`, will be generated, rather than two: `bear.svg` with the original colors and `bear-white.svg` with white colors.


### Grunticon Loader Methods

With `enhanceSVG` turned on, the Grunticon loader has a few exposed methods and attributes on the `grunticon` object that you can use:

#### href
Type: `String`

The url that is being loaded by Grunticon.

#### method
Type: `String`

Is `"svg"` if the page loaded the SVG-based css.
Is `"datapng"` if the page loaded the png with datauri-based css.
Is `"png"` if the page loaded the plain link to png-based css.

#### loadCSS
See: https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadcss

#### getCSS
Arguments: `String`
Returns: `Object`

Fetch a stylesheet `link` by its `href`.

#### getIcons
Arguments: `String`
Returns: `Object`

Takes a stylesheet node (`link` or `style`) and returns all of the icon selectors and the svgs contained within it in an object formatted
in this way:
```
{
  grunticon:selector: "SVG Content in String"
}
```

#### embedIcons
Arguments: `Object`
Returns: `NodeList`

Takes icons in the object format outputted by `getIcons` and then queries the page for all icons with the
`data-grunticon-embed` attribute. For each of these that it finds, it places the SVG contents associated with
the relevant selector in the icons. It then returns the NodeList of all of the elements that had SVGs embedded
in them.

#### ready
Arguments: `Function`
Returns: None

An alternative to listening for the `DOMContentLoaded` event. Takes a function as a callback and calls the function
when the DOM is ready.

#### svgLoadedCallback
Arguments: `Function`
Returns: None

Uses the above methods to call:
```
var svgLoadedCallback = function( embedComplete ){
  ready(function(){
    embedIcons(getIcons(grunticon.href));
    embedComplete();
  });
}
```

If `embedComplete` is defined, the loader will call it when SVG embedding is complete. This is true for both local and CORS embedding. So if you need to run logic after SVG markup is appended to the DOM, just pass a callback to `grunticon.svgLoadedCallback` or `grunticon.svgLoadedCORSCallback`.


### Cross-domain SVG Embedding Methods

With `enhanceSVG` and `corsEmbed` turned on, the Grunticon loader has a few exposed 2 more methods and attributes on the `grunticon` object that you can use:

#### ajaxGet
Arguments: `String`, `Function`
Returns: `Object`

First argument is a string reference to a url to request via cross-domain Ajax. Second argument is an optional callback when the request finishes loading. (In the callback, `this` refers to the XHR object).


#### svgLoadedCORSCallback
Arguments: `Function`
Returns: None

Uses the above methods to make SVG embedding work when CSS is hosted on another domain. (CORS must be allowed on the external domain.)



## Browser testing results for icon output

## Tips

### Cleaning the cruft out of your SVGs

In earlier versions of Grunticon, we included SVGO to optimize the SVG output. In the 1.0
version, we removed this dependency to ease the installation complexity but still recommend
that SVG optimization is part of the Grunticon workflow.

When producing SVGs through a tool like Illustrator, there is a lot of
unnecessary markup, comments, and general code written into your SVG
files. Because of that, we strongly recommend using a tool like [grunt-svgmin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-svgmin).
If run before running Grunticon, it can greatly reduce your filesizes!

Here's an example:

```js
svgmin: {
	dist: {
		options: {
			plugins: [
				// Don't remove XML declaration (needed to avoid errors creating PNG on Win 7)
				{ removeXMLProcInst: false }
			]
		},
		files: [{
			expand: true,
			cwd: 'example/svgs',
			src: ['*.svg'],
			dest: 'example/source'
		}]
	}
},
grunticon: {
	foo: {
		files: [{
			expand: true,
			cwd: 'example/source',
			src: ['*.svg', '*.png'],
			dest: "example/output"
		}],
		options: {
		}
	}
}
```

The svgmin options section is only needed to avoid errors under windows and can be omitted for smaller svg files on other platforms. For a more extensive example, check out our Gruntfile example project.

### Serving compressed CSS
One of the great benefits to data uris is the ability to compress the images heavily via gzip compression. Be sure to enable gzip of CSS on your server, as it'll cut your icon transfer size greatly.

### Creating SVG Artwork

The workflow we've been using so far involves creating a new Illustrator file with the artboard set to the desired size of the icon you want set in the CSS.

Export the artwork by choosing File > Save as...  In the dialog, choose "SVG" as the format and enter a name for the file (this wil be used as your class name later, so keep it free of any disallowed CSS class characters like `.`, `{`, `(`, `)`, etc.

In the Save SVG dialog that opens up, there are lots of options. SVG has a ton of formats, so here are a few tips we've learned.

- SVG Profile: Seems like SVG 1.1 Tiny is really well supported across even older mobile platforms so if you have simple artwork that doesn't use gradients or opacity this will yield a smaller and more compatible graphic. If you want to use all the fancy effects, save artwork as SVG 1.1.
- Type: Convert to outline before export.
- Subsetting: None, I usually convert all text to outlines ahead of time
- Images: Embed
- Don't check "Preserve Illustrator editing" to reduce file size

## Warnings
* If your files have `#`, `.`, `>`, or any other css selecting character in their names, they will likely be improperly processed.


## Windows
- Make sure the svg files starts and includes `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>`
- Make sure to properly configure  `svgmin` by keeping `XML` instructions with `removeXMLProcInst` option
 
```js
...
    svgmin: {
      dist: {
        options: {
          plugins: [
            { removeXMLProcInst: false }// this option matter.
          ]
        },
        files: ...
      }
    },
...
````
